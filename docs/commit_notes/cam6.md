# Cam6

What changed
- Adjusted horizontal mapping so only the left player uses the flipped x-axis.

Manual test steps
- Run `python3 -m air_hockey.main`.
- Move left and right player balls left/right and confirm mallets follow the same direction.

Known issues
- If either side still feels inverted, we can add per-player invert toggles.
