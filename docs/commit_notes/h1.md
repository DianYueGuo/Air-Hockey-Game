# H1

What changed
- Added a PyInstaller spec for building the AirHockey executable.
- Added placeholder icon files expected by the build.

Manual test steps
- Run `pyinstaller tools/package/pyinstaller.spec` (after installing dev deps).
- Verify the build includes the `assets` directory.

Known issues
- Icon files are placeholders and should be replaced with real binary icons.
