# F2

What changed
- Added fullscreen and display index options to window settings.
- App now selects display index when supported and falls back safely.

Manual test steps
- Run `python -m air_hockey.main`.
- Temporarily set `WindowOptions.fullscreen = True` or `display_index` in `src/air_hockey/app.py`.
- Verify the window opens on the selected display or falls back to the primary display.

Known issues
- Display selection is best-effort and depends on pygame version/platform support.
