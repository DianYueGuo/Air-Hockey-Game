# Phys8

What changed
- Reduced puck friction and damping further for a more slippery feel.

Manual test steps
- Run `python3 -m air_hockey.main`.
- Strike the puck and confirm it slides longer before stopping.

Known issues
- Existing settings may override defaults; lower Puck Damping in Physics Tuning if needed.
