# D3

What changed
- Split the camera frame into left/right halves for player tracking.
- Mapped detected ball positions to mallet positions with naive normalization.
- Added per-player HSV presets (orange for left, tennis for right).

Manual test steps
- Run `python -m air_hockey.main`.
- Click Play with two differently colored balls in each half of the camera frame.
- Verify mallets follow their respective balls; keyboard still works if no detection.

Known issues
- No calibration or smoothing yet; tracking can feel jittery.
