# F1

What changed
- Added scoreboard mode selection (HUD vs separate window).
- Implemented a separate scoreboard window using pygame._sdl2 when available.
- Play screen falls back to HUD if a separate window cannot be created.

Manual test steps
- Run `python -m air_hockey.main`.
- In code, set scoreboard mode to WINDOW and verify a new window shows the score if pygame._sdl2 is available.
- If unavailable, confirm HUD still shows the score.

Known issues
- Separate window support depends on pygame._sdl2 availability on the platform.
