# D4

What changed
- Added webcam view modes (hidden/overlay/separate window) in window options.
- Play screen renders a bottom-center overlay preview by default.
- Separate OpenCV window is supported when the mode is set to WINDOW.

Manual test steps
- Run `python -m air_hockey.main`.
- Click Play and confirm the small overlay preview appears at the bottom-center.
- Temporarily set the mode to WINDOW in code and verify the OpenCV window opens.

Known issues
- View mode is currently hard-coded; no UI toggle yet.
