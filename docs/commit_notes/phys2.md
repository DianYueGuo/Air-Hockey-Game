# Phys2

What changed
- Reduced default puck friction and damping so the puck slides longer.

Manual test steps
- Run `python3 -m air_hockey.main`.
- In Play, hit the puck and confirm it glides longer before stopping.

Known issues
- Existing settings may override defaults; adjust Physics Tuning if needed.
