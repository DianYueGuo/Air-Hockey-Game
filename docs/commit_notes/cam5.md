# Cam5

What changed
- Flipped the horizontal mapping so left/right hand movement matches mallet movement.

Manual test steps
- Run `python3 -m air_hockey.main`.
- Move the tracked ball left/right and confirm the mallet follows the same direction.

Known issues
- If calibration was done with the previous mapping, recalibrate for best results.
